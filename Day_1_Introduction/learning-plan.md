# Why Does DevOps Exist?

## Problem
End users want software that is **fast**, **reliable**, and **works properly**.

---

## Traditional Software Delivery (Before DevOps)

1. Developers write code on their **PC/Laptop**
2. Code is compressed (zip file) and shared with the **Operations team**
3. Multiple teams handle deployment:
   - System Administrator
   - Network Administrator
   - Database Administrator
   - Tester / QA Engineer
4. Each team works **separately**
5. Deployment takes **days or weeks**

### Problems with This Approach
- Slow delivery
- Manual processes
- Frequent errors
- "Works on my machine" issues
- Blame between Development and Operations teams

---

## Why DevOps Was Introduced

In **2009**, **Patrick Debois** introduced **DevOps**.

DevOps was created to:
- Combine **Development** and **Operations**
- Automate build, test, and deployment
- Reduce manual work and errors
- Deliver software faster

---

## What DevOps Solves

- Faster software delivery
- Better collaboration between teams
- Automated deployments
- Stable and reliable applications
- Happier end users

---
## DevOps Collaboration & Mindset

### Development and Operations Collaboration
Development teams work closely with Operations teams to deliver software efficiently.

---

## DevOps Mindset

- **Time to Market (Reduced)**
  - Faster release of features and fixes

- **Collaboration (Tools Driven)**
  - Git – version control
  - Slack – team communication
  - Jira – task and issue tracking

- **Scale**
  - Handle increased users and traffic easily

- **Scale on Demand**
  - Cloud platforms enable automatic scaling

- **Stability**
  - Stable applications through testing and automation

- **System / Platform Shell**
  - Standardized environments for consistency

---

## DevOps (DevOps Engineering)

DevOps is a **culture and mindset** where:
- Development and Operations teams collaborate
- Repetitive tasks are automated
- Time to market is reduced
- Systems scale smoothly for end users

---

## One-Line Summary

> **DevOps combines people, process, and tools to deliver software faster, stable, and at scale.**

## Simple Definition

**DevOps is a culture and set of practices that helps teams deliver software faster and more reliably by bringing Development and Operations together.**

---

## One-Line Summary

> **DevOps exists to move code from developer to end user quickly, safely, and smoothly.**
